This repository displays 3 projects of mine. "deeplearning" is a personal project using PyTorch to train a neural network; the notebook was used for experimentation and visualization. training.py optionally takes --lr and --epochs parameters, and optimizer outputs an optimized learning rate after being run. "nonlinear_filters" is a solo project created as part of the proseminar "Image Processing". "reversiAI" is a collaborative work in a group of 3, created for the software practical. The reports in that project outline who did what. Most of what we did there was Java programming, but I managed to sneak in some image processing by building a "map generator," which generates game maps based on an input image; this is elaborated upon in report 1, task 3.
