This repository displays 3 projects of mine. "deeplearning" is a personal project using pytorch to train a neural network, the notebook was used for experimentation and visualisation,
training.py optionally takes --lr and --epochs parameters and optimizer spits out an optimized learning rate after beeing run. 
"nonlinear_filters" is a solo project created as part of the proseminar "Image Processing".
"reversiAI" is a collaborative work in a group of 3 created for the software practical, the reports in that project outline who did what, most of what we did there was java programming but I managed to sneak in
some image processing by building a "map generator" which would generate game maps based on an input image, this is elaborated upon in report 1 task 3.
